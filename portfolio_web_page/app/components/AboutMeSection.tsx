      <p>
      I have been involved in front-end development for over three years, specializing in React.js and TypeScript. I have participated in developing applications from scratch, setting up Webpack. I mainly use the React, Redux-Toolkit, and TypeScript stack, and for testing, I use Jest and react-testing-library, adhering to the FSD architecture.
